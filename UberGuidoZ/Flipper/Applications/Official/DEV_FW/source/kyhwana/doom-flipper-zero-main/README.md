# Doom Flipper Zero edition

## Will it run Doom?
As tradition goes, Doom is being ported to almost every possible embedded electronic device. Therefore I did an attempt to come up with something close to Doom and still compatible on the Flipper Zero's hardware.<br> This is not the actual Doom game but a port made from yet another Doom port to the Arduino Nano (https://github.com/daveruiz/doom-nano/). This port is basically a raycasting engine, using Doom sprites.<br>
This version is very basic and might be improved over time.

## How to install on Flipper Zero
Build just like any other external application (.fap): https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/AppsOnSDCard.md. No firmware modification needed anymore!
